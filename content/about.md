## About Me

Ally Michelson is pursuing a BFA in Studio Art at Appalachian State University in Boone, North Carolina, focusing on metalsmithing and painting. Their work reflects on self-discovery and connections between barriers and personal understanding, exploring boundaries and the unknown through symbolism in windows, doors, stars, and numbers.

## Artist Statement

Art has always been a place where complex ideas and emotions can be turned into something tangible. In my recent work, I represent subconscious ideas that I have been drawn to and have thought about for years. My art is both a reflection of my internal experiences and a way to communicate those experiences to others.

Barriers, embodied by windows, doors, and gates, are recurring motifs, symbolizing boundaries between the known and unknown, the visible and hidden. They define space, create divisions, control interaction, and ask questions like, "What is on the other side?" These elements represent how I process and compartmentalize life, serving as both physical and metaphorical tools for understanding the world around me.

Numbers are another central theme, reflecting my compulsive need to count everything. Steps, noises, things around me, patterns; I am always striving for order and repetition. This obsessive counting creates structure in the chaos, and through art, I release these patterns, turning internal struggles into something real. Counting is my way of understanding the unknown or things that are not in my control.

Barriers, like doors, windows, and gates, are the physical representation of this. They are what separates the known and the unknown. They are how I open myself to the world, how I close myself off, and how I separate my life into different sections to be able to understand it better.

Art allows me to navigate barriers, process, and bridge the gap between inner and outer worlds. By transforming obsession into physical forms, I seek connection and understanding, one counted step at a time.
