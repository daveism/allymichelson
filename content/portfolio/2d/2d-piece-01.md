<!-- ## Process example s-->

<!-- This piece started as a series of rough sketches exploring organic forms. The goal was to capture movement and texture through layered mark-making.

## Detail Shots

Here are some close-up views showing the texture and brushwork:

</div>

<p class="caption">Left: detail of upper section. Right: close-up of texture work.</p>

## Progression

The piece went through several stages before reaching its final form:

  <img src="/images/2d/2d-06.jpg" alt="Near final" />
</div>

## Inspiration

> The best art comes from a place of curiosity, not certainty.

This work was inspired by natural erosion patterns found in canyon walls. Below is a reference photo alongside the study it inspired:
